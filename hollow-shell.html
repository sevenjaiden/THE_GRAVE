            Founded upon the principle that “Eden” was never a planet, 
            but a People, The Hollow Shell Faction has facilitated the 
            evacuation of millions of citizens. Hollow Shell believes 
            that Eden is a dead planet. They had not referred to it 
            by its original name since The Breach. Eden is no longer 
            their home. They have made every effort 
            to leave the planet behind. Efforts such as establishing 
            refugee agreements to get citizens off-planet to more 
            habitable environments and repairing and 
            reconstructing old colony ships.
