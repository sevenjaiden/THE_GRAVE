            After many years of extensive research and testing,  
            scientists and engineers of The Khvostov Group concluded 
            that curved blades were most efficient at cutting and 
            slashing with minimal resistance. For this reason, 
            K-4 Units were equipped with long curved swords that 
            featured a small guard and a long handle. Long handles 
            increased maneuverability and long curved blades increased 
            cutting ability. These weapons were designed with nothing 
            else but the mission of these androids in mind.The particular 
            piece on display was recovered within the grounds of the Deep 
            Academy, a once-renowned learning institute and library. 
            The Academy was located in Malphur Passage within its Sixth Wall.
