            More of a cult than anything else, The Eternal Flare Oder 
            believed that it was a higher power that decided that Eden 
            must be punished under such horrific conditions. They prayed to  
            and believed that one day after it had been 
            deemed that they had suffered enough, they would be saved
            and a new seed would be planted for a world more prosperous than the
            last. However, they did not ever align with New Bearing’s 
            efforts to stay as they believed that they must not try to 
            save themselves. They believed that we had done 
            the unforgivable and that we must suffer 
            completely for our sins.
