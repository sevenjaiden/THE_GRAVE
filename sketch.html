        This drawing was recovered buried in the ruins
        at the Northern end of the Yotsa Bridge in Vista,
        House of Kells. It depicts two K-4 Units standing
        together in an unknown location (supposedly
        somewhere near the bridge). This is one of many
        artworks discovered depicting K-4 Units as well
        as other Khvostov androids. However, this drawing
        regularly pulls the attention of researchers.
        It is the only observation sketch that features
        K-4 Units operating in a non-hostile state.
        They have a calm and almost inquisitive
        demeanour in this depiction. The drawing is not signed
        and the creator is unknown The incongruous nature of this
        image pushed researchers to ask: “What was the true purpose of K-4?”
