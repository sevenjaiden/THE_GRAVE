        “The Gates”, formally known as  Food Bank Podiums, 
        stood between citizens of The Grave and their next meal. 
        Citizens would line up by the hundreds every day at these 
        podiums and wait to be granted entry into the Food Bank. 
        These were large cuboid-shaped buildings that provided citizens 
        with consistent meals amid the uncertainty of the environment. 
        In reality, Food Banks would often run out of food before a 
        fraction of people could be served. At this point, entrances 
        would be sealed, podiums would flash red, and K-4 Units would 
        be swiftly deployed.
