            As the founder of New Bearing, the faction responsible 
            for the restoration, as well as The Museum and The Karn 
            Foundation, Mikolaj Karn devoted his life to the 
            liberation and freedom of the people of The Grave. 
            After the restoration, The Karn Foundation 
            was formed and from it came this museum. The Bearing 
            Museum stands tall and proud as a symbol of the undying 
            will of the citizens of Novus Eden (New Eden). 
            The horrific tragedies that befell our home so many 
            years ago will not be forgotten. 
            <br>
            Before his death, Mikolaj 
            insisted that museum not be named after him.
            <br>
            <span id = quote>
            “The Museum does not stand for me. It stands for us all. 
            And it will keep doing so. The people will continue to stoke the flames that 
            led us from darkness” - Mikolaj Karn
