            Tasked with designing the most capable instrument of 
            death The System had ever seen, Dr. Amanda Holliday, 
            head of mechanical and computer engineering and design 
            at Khvostov Headquarters, knew what she was doing by 
            spearheading the K-4 Initiative: A technologically superior 
            android that was designed and programmed with a single 
            prime directive. That directive was codenamed “K-4” and 
            guided the android’s functions. These functions include 
            and were limited to neutralizing, terminating, expunging, 
            destroying, and killing. Unlike other military units, the 
            K-4 Units were given no medical functions, no search and 
            rescue functions, and no informational assistance functions. <br>
            The K-4 Unit, when deployed, had one job: Purge.
