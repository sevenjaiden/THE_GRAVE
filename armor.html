        K-4 Units were equipped with custom-designed cargo pants for a few reasons:<br>
        · Protection. The pants were constructed from a synthetic material that mixed tungsten/steel alloy (durability), carbon fiber (lightweight), and polyurethane (waterproof). 
        · Research. Once scientists studied the most capable and merciless combat styles in the known system, they determined that the legs of the fighter were the most important and needed to be protected.<br>
        · Uniformity. Those tasked with the creation of combat and medical androids opted to design some kind of uniform. They believed that putting them in uniform would help the people feel safer and that they could “look up to” these mechanical humanoids.
