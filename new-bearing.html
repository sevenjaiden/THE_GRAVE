            New Bearing, the largest of the three factions,
            believed that there is still hope
            for Eden to rise from the ashes. They believed 
            that Eden can be saved through their efforts. 
            Some included attempts to shift the planet back 
            into place, developed protocols by which humans 
            can live to take advantage of the realities of 
            their new world, and protested against exploitation 
            by other planets and organisations 
            to take back their identity.
